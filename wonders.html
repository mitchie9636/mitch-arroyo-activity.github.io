           <p>Boracay is a small island approximately 200 miles south of Manila and is very close to the major 
            island of Panay. Its white sand beaches and direct flights from all over Asia have made it one of
             the Philippines most popular tourist destinations. White Beach is the longest beach on Boracay and 
             extends 4 kilometers on the west side of the islands.</p> <br><br><br>

Located in southeast Luzon, it is one of the most active volcanoes in the world. It has erupted close to 50 times with the most recent eruption occurring in 2006. Almost 80 people were killed in an eruption in 1993 and 75,000 people had to be evacuated from their homes during an eruption in 1984. It rises 2462m over Legazpi City in the province of Albay.</p> <br> <br>

            <h1>Chocolate Hills</h1>
            <p>The Chocolate Hills are located on the Island of Bohol. They get their name because the grass which covers the hills turns brown during the dry season. The hills are almost all conical in shape and made of limestone. Many people have believed that they were human creations. Geologists are not entirely sure how they were created. Theories include erosion of limestone, volcanic uplift, and accretion of limestone around basalt fragments from a volcanic eruption. The government of the Philippines has declared it one of their flagship tourist destinations. The Chocolate Hills are so central to the people of Bohol, they appear on the flag of the province.</p> <br> <br>

            <p>The Banaue Rice Terraces are perhaps the most well know attraction in the Philippines, and no list of the Seven Wonders of the Philippines would be complete without them. Located in central Luzon, they have been carved by local Ifugao people over the last 3,000 years. When you visit, you can see terraces still being built today. The locals often describe the terraces as the largest man-made structure created without forced labor. If each terrace were laid end to end, they would stretch almost 14,000 miles. They were declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1995.</p> <br> <br>
